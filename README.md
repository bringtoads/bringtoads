## Hi there 👋

I’m Ajay, a software developer with a strong focus on backend and database-driven applications.
I primarily work with C# / .NET on business systems, but I also enjoy exploring other areas
of software development in my own time.

⚡ **Fun fact**
I enjoy working on “boring” software. The kind that needs to be correct, stable,
and easy to maintain long after it’s shipped.
